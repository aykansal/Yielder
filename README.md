## The Problem: Yield Farming is Hard

Providing liquidity to earn yield can be a complicated and expensive process. Yielder is designed to fix these common challenges:

* **Constant Monitoring:** You have to constantly watch the markets to find the best returns.
* **Time-Consuming:** Frequently moving your funds between pools to chase better yields is tedious.
* **High Complexity:** Managing investments across many different platforms (e.g., Permaswap, Botega) is confusing and difficult.

## The Solution: Yielder Makes it Easy

Yielder is an automated system that handles the entire yield farming process for you:

* **Smart Analysis:** Yielder constantly analyzes performance metrics like APR, TVL, and Swap Fees to find the most profitable liquidity pools across supported DEXs.
* **Automatic Staking:** Once the best pool is found, the protocol automatically deploys your assets into it.
* **Dynamic Rebalancing:** Yielder continuously monitors the market. If a more profitable opportunity appears, it automatically moves your funds to the better pool.
* **Simple Portfolio Management:** Your entire position is represented by a single token: the **Yielder LP Token (YLP)**. This simplifies portfolio management down to tracking a single asset.
* **Shared Costs:** By managing assets collectively, the protocol socializes transaction costs, leading to greater capital efficiency for everyone involved.

## How It Works: The Yielder Lifecycle

The Yielder protocol automates the entire yield farming lifecycle through a sophisticated, multi-stage process designed to be completely hands-off for the user after the initial deposit.

![Yielder Workflow](./processes/yirlder.png)

### 1. On-Chain Analysis & Pool Discovery üìà

Yielder continuously monitors all supported liquidity pools to identify the most profitable opportunities.

* **On-Demand Analysis:** A user can call the `Best-Stake` handler with a token pair to get an immediate recommendation for the best pool.
* **Continuous Background Monitoring:** An automated cron job runs every two minutes, calling the `cronnn` handler to fetch the latest data for all supported pools, ensuring the system's information is always up-to-date.
* **Metric Calculation:** It calculates critical performance indicators for each pool in real-time, including Total Value Locked (TVL), 24-Hour Volume, and Annual Percentage Rate (APR).

### 2. Automated Liquidity Provision üîó

Once a user decides to stake, Yielder acts as a proxy to execute the transaction on their behalf.

* The protocol takes the user's deposited tokens and programmatically calls the `AddLiquidity` function on the optimal DEX pool (either on Permaswap or Botega).
* The DEX pool then mints its native LP token and sends it directly to the Yielder process, which holds it in custody within its treasury.

### 3. YLP Token Abstraction üéüÔ∏è

In exchange for the deposited assets, Yielder mints and distributes its own derivative token, the **`YLP` (Yielder LP Token)**, to the user.

* The `YLP` token serves as a liquid receipt for the user's stake.
* This powerfully abstracts the investment‚Äîthe user's entire, potentially complex position is represented by this single `YLP` token, drastically simplifying portfolio management.

### 4. Continuous Optimization & Rebalancing ü§ñ

The true power of Yielder lies in its autonomous optimization engine.

* The `Auto-Yield-Optimizer` handler periodically analyzes the fresh market data.
* It compares the APR of the pool currently holding a user's funds against all other available pools for the same token pair.
* If the optimizer finds a new pool with a significantly higher APR, it automatically triggers a rebalance‚Äîwithdrawing liquidity from the underperforming pool and redeploying it into the new, higher-yielding one.

### 5. Seamless Redemption üì§

When a user wants to exit their position, the process is as simple as the deposit.

* The user calls the `burn` handler, sending their `YLP` tokens back to the Yielder process.
* Yielder calculates the user's proportional share of the underlying assets, withdraws them from the appropriate DEX pool(s), and transfers the base tokens directly back to the user's wallet.

## Protocol Architecture

### Key Processes

* **Main Yielder Process:** The central smart contract that contains all protocol logic and also serves as the `YLP` token contract.
    * **Process ID:** `SpJdYt1_CdMG0W5JjDVYfu-tJNGB2bXC6usBSyrQAys`
* **Cron Job Process:** A utility process that calls the main process's handlers every two minutes to refresh data.
    * **Process ID:** `pim8QULY_SxUwx8yMarH4O4NwiWtP4awcgyGhgsE-FA`

### Core Assets (Yielder Token Suite)

These are custom test tokens used within the Yielder ecosystem for providing liquidity.

* **YT1:** `_IxG5qxfgSBBj1wH7BL0j1vkihOcfx2ntXS19NZjDFU`
* **YT2:** `Zg8ihIkD2Tpm2E0vRbJSD0J3Jb3dqK8XUZ4OlOZ9kcc`
* **YT3:** `CgD7STeX0_VDlNwNnB4_qQLg4nb4okqXQgTki0sFXSM`

### Integrated Liquidity Pools

Yielder actively monitors and manages liquidity across the following live pools on Permaswap and Botega.

| Token Pair  | DEX       | Pool Address & Link                                                                                                 |

## Getting Started: A User's Guide

### Step 1: Acquire Test Tokens

Use the built-in airdrop handlers to get test tokens sent directly to your wallet.
* **Get 10 YT1:**
    ```lua
    Send({Target="SpJdYt1_CdMG0W5JjDVYfu-tJNGB2bXC6usBSyrQAys", Action = "YT1Airdrop", Quantity="10"})
    ```
* **Get 20 YT2:**
    ```lua
    Send({Target="SpJdYt1_CdMG0W5JjDVYfu-tJNGB2bXC6usBSyrQAys", Action = "YT2Airdrop", Quantity="20"})
    ```
* **Get 30 YT3:**
    ```lua
    Send({Target="SpJdYt1_CdMG0W5JjDVYfu-tJNGB2bXC6usBSyrQAys", Action = "YT3Airdrop", Quantity="30"})
    ```

### Step 2: Find the Best Pool to Stake In üîç
Use the `Best-Stake` handler to perform a live analysis and find the most profitable pool for a given pair.

```bash
Send({ 
    Target = "SpJdYt1_CdMG0W5JjDVYfu-tJNGB2bXC6usBSyrQAys",
    Action = "Best-Stake",
    TokenX = "_IxG5qxfgSBBj1wH7BL0j1vkihOcfx2ntXS19NZjDFU", -- YT1
    TokenY = "Zg8ihIkD2Tpm2E0vRbJSD0J3Jb3dqK8XUZ4OlOZ9kcc"  -- YT2
})
```

### Step 3: Stake Your Tokens üîó
First, transfer your tokens to the Yielder Process. Then, call the `Stake-User-Token` handler. The protocol will automatically stake them in the optimal pool and mint `YLP` tokens back to you.

```bash
Send({ 
    Target = "SpJdYt1_CdMG0W5JjDVYfu-tJNGB2bXC6usBSyrQAys",
    Action = "Stake-User-Token", 
    Pool = "Q9uyLNaNvuFHvNrQQZ_XuOrRZ6OEE0KqSEPJJj8Z4Ys", -- Example Pool ID from Step 2
    User = "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
    TokenXAddress ="_IxG5qxfgSBBj1wH7BL0j1vkihOcfx2ntXS19NZjDFU", 
    TokenXQuantity = "2000000000000",  
    TokenYAddress ="Zg8ihIkD2Tpm2E0vRbJSD0J3Jb3dqK8XUZ4OlOZ9kcc", 
    TokenYQuantity = "2727272727272"
})
```
### Step 4: Withdraw Your Assets üì§
To exit your position, simply call the `burn` handler with your `YLP` tokens. The protocol will automatically withdraw the underlying assets from the DEX and return them to your wallet.
